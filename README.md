Lockdown sure is difficult to be dealt. As people who live in a heavily hit region (Italy), we have been firmly invited to stay home, going outside only for primary needs. When this all started, everybody was quite positive and the first days have passed easily. Now situation is becoming harder, especially for those people who were used to do long walks and spend a lot of time outside. We tried to come up with a solution to this, or at least with our personal way to help everybody to actually avoid going outside. With this in mind, we started developing the project SofaSoGood.
We designed an app prototype solution that could track users in order to understand if they are respecting the rules, being at home. It is quite straightforward: position is tracked, the more you stay home, the more you gain points that can be used to redeem rewards.
Rewards are offered by Partners, both Companies and Cultural entities (such as museums or cinemas). This way, Partners can actively take part in the challenge and help population dealing with the lockdown.
Our idea is that in future, this solution could be integrated with the national Covid-19 related Italian app called Immuni. This app, that people can download voluntarily, is able to keep track of people movements and interactions by Bluetooth Low Energy technology and GPS. The use of this app by a wide amount of people is really important, in order to maintain social distance and control the infection even after the lockdown is over. This integration would be great in order to encourage people to use it and keep people safe at home.
