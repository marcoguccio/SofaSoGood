# SofaSoGood
Lockdown sure is difficult to be dealt. As people who live in a heavily hit region (Italy), we have been firmly invited to stay home, going outside only for primary needs. When this all started, everybody was quite positive and the first days have passed easily. Now situation is becoming harder, especially for those people who were used to do long walks and spend a lot of time outside. We tried to come up with a solution to this, or at least with our personal way to help everybody to actually avoid going outside. With this in mind, we started developing the project SofaSoGood.
